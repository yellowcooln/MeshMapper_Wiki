# Privacy Notice

**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026

MeshMapper ("we", "us", or "our") operates the MeshMapper platform at meshmapper.net and its associated regional subdomains. This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our services.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information
When you associate via Discord OAuth, we receive your Discord user ID, username, and avatar. We use this solely for automated notification purposes.

### Location and Coverage Data
When you participate in wardriving sessions, the following data is collected:

- **GPS coordinates** (latitude and longitude) of your device during active sessions
- **Signal metrics** such as RSSI, SNR, and hop counts
- **Session metadata** including timestamps, region, and session identifiers
- **Node identifiers** for mesh network repeaters and devices encountered, including your device name

This data is essential to the core function of MeshMapper: building community-driven RF coverage maps.

### Technical Data
We may collect standard technical information such as:

- IP addresses (used for rate limiting and abuse prevention)
- Browser user-agent strings
- Server access logs

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide the service:** Display RF coverage maps, leaderboards, and network analytics
- **Manage sessions:** Track active wardriving sessions and associate data with contributors
- **Improve the platform:** Analyze aggregate usage patterns to improve map accuracy and features
- **Prevent abuse:** Rate limiting, session validation, and security monitoring

## Data Sharing and Visibility

- **Coverage data is public.** GPS-tagged signal data submitted through wardriving is displayed on publicly accessible maps. This is the core purpose of MeshMapper.
- **Leaderboard data is public.** Usernames and contribution statistics appear on regional and global leaderboards (if "anonymous" mode is not enabled on the wardriving app).
- **We do not sell your personal data** to third parties.
- **We do not share your data with advertisers.**
- We may share data with regional administrators who manage their respective MeshMapper regions.

## Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored in databases on our servers.
- Sessions are managed server-side using PHP sessions and API key authentication.
- MQTT-ingested wardriving packets are encrypted with AES and decrypted server-side.
- We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
