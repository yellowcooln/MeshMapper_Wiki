# Coverage API

The Coverage API provides programmatic access to MeshMapper coverage grid-square data. Use it to draw coverage grids on your own maps or integrate MeshMapper data into external tools and dashboards.

## Authentication

Access requires a **Coverage** API key. Each key is scoped to a specific region or multiregion group and has a daily rate limit of 100 requests.

### Generating a Key

Regional administrators can generate their own API key directly from the admin panel:

1. Log in to your region's admin panel
2. Go to **User Settings**
3. Scroll to the **API Access** section
4. Enter a description/reason for the key (mandatory)
5. Click **Generate API Key**

Each administrator is limited to **one API key per region**. The key is automatically scoped to your region with a fixed rate limit of 100 requests per day. If you need to replace your key, use the **Regenerate** button — this invalidates the old key immediately.

!!! warning "Unauthorized Access"
    MeshMapper utilizes API keys and rate limits to protect server resources and prevent access to data that regions do not wish to have shared externally.  As such, accessing unauthorized API's, scraping for data, etc., is strictly prohibited and will result in action taken to protect the server and data (which may include IP or origin bans, removal of a region, etc.).  The MeshMapper team is happy to review requests for data not provided in the API's below.

## Field Reference

### Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | boolean | `true` if the request succeeded. |
| `region` | string | The region or group code this key is scoped to. |
| `grid_size` | object | Grid square dimensions in degrees (`lat` and `lon`). |
| `generated_at` | integer | Unix timestamp of when the response was generated. |
| `total_squares` | integer | Number of grid squares returned. |
| `grid_squares` | array | Array of grid square objects (see below). |

### Grid Square Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grid_id` | string | Unique identifier for the grid cell in `"latIndex_lonIndex"` format. |
| `bounds` | object | Bounding box with `south`, `west`, `north`, `east` in decimal degrees. |
| `coverage_type` | string | One of: `BIDIR`, `TX`, `RX`, `DISC`, `DEAD`, `DROP`. |
| `fill_color` | string | Hex fill colour matching MeshMapper's map rendering. |
| `border_color` | string | Hex border colour matching MeshMapper's map rendering. |
| `snr` | float or null | Signal-to-noise ratio of the dominant ping, if available. |
| `timestamp` | integer or null | Unix timestamp of the ping colouring this grid square. |

## Coverage Types

When multiple pings exist in the same grid square, the highest-priority type wins.

| Type | Colour | Priority | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BIDIR` | Green (`#1e7e34`) | 6 | Two-way confirmed link. |
| `DISC` | Cyan (`#17a2b8`) | 5 | Discovery or trace packet. |
| `TX` | Orange (`#fd7e14`) | 4 | Transmitted but not heard back. |
| `RX` | Purple (`#6f42c1`) | 3 | Heard traffic, without transmitting. |
| `DEAD` | Grey (`#6c757d`) | 2 | Repeater heard but no route. |
| `DROP` | Red (`#bd2130`) | 1 | No connection. |

## Drawing Grid Squares

Each grid square can be reconstructed as a rectangle using the `bounds` object:

```javascript
// Leaflet.js example
data.grid_squares.forEach(sq => {
    L.rectangle(
        [[sq.bounds.south, sq.bounds.west], [sq.bounds.north, sq.bounds.east]],
        {
            fillColor: sq.fill_color,
            color: sq.border_color,
            fillOpacity: 0.6,
            weight: 1
        }
    ).addTo(map);
});
```

The grid uses fixed cell sizes of **0.0027 degrees latitude** by **0.00384 degrees longitude** (approximately 300m squares). These match MeshMapper's Simplified Mode rendering.

## Rate Limits

Each API key has a daily request limit. Counters reset daily.

When you exceed your limit, the API returns HTTP 429:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Daily request limit reached",
  "limit": 100,
  "used": 100,
  "resets_in_hours": 12.5
}
```

## Error Responses

| HTTP Code | Error | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `missing_key` | No API key provided. |
| 400 | `invalid_region` | Region code on key not found. |
| 401 | `invalid_key` | API key not found. |
| 403 | `no_region` | No region assigned to this key. |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Daily request limit reached. |
| 500 | `server_error` | Internal error (database not found, etc.). |

## Managing Your Key

If you have a Coverage API key assigned to your admin account, you can view your current usage and regenerate your key from the **User Settings** tab in your region's Admin Portal. Regenerating a key invalidates the old one immediately.
