# Admin Portal

The **MeshMapper Admin Portal** is a restricted area designed for region maintainers to manage data integrity, configure system settings, and monitor the health of a regions map.

## Access & Permissions

Access to the Admin Portal is strictly controlled. It is not available to general users.

  - **How to get access:** Reach out to one of the [MeshMapper administrators](https://wiki.meshmapper.net/administratorlist/) to get credentials.

## Dashboard & Active Sessions

Upon logging in, the dashboard presents a live view of **Active Sessions**.

  - **Real-time Monitoring:** See who is currently wardriving in your region.
  - **Capacity Management:** Displays the current slot usage (e.g., 2/5 slots).
  - **Kick User:** Admins can forcibly end a session if a user is stuck or consuming a slot unnecessarily.

## Data Management

The portal is divided into several tabs for managing different data types.

### Coverage
This tab allows granular control over individual data points (pings).

  - **Search:** Find pings by User, Time, or Repeater ID.
  - **Edit:** Correct erroneous data (e.g., if a user forgot to flag "External Antenna" or entered the wrong power level).
  - **Delete:** Remove individual bad data points.
  - **Debug:** If "Debug Mode" was enabled during the drive, a **Debug** button appears, allowing admins to inspect the raw JSON payload received from the device.

### Repeaters
Manage the repeaters database.

  - **Add/Edit:** Manually register repeaters or update their details (Name, Location, Power).
  - **Status Control:**
    - **Active:** The default state. The repeater is visible on the map, included in leaderboards, and actively associating with coverage pings.
    - **Disabled:** The repeater is hidden from the public map and leaderboards but remains in the database for historical purposes.
    - **Inactive:** The repeater hasn't sent an advert in the last 30 days and has been removed from from the map.
    - **Pending:** The repeater has been discovered but is awaiting approval. Pending repeaters are **not** visible on the map and do not associate with coverage data. This state is only used when the "New Repeaters Enter Pending State" setting is enabled for the region. Admins can approve a pending repeater by editing it and setting its status to **Active**. Pending repeaters that have existed for 3× the stale timer will be automatically approved if still actively being heard, or deleted if not.
    - **Excluded:** The repeater is flagged as a duplicate. It appears as a **Red** icon on the map. Coverage data is **not** associated with this repeater to prevent skewing statistics (with the exception of **DISCOVERY** type pings).

    !!! warning "Duplicate Repeater Persistence"
        **You cannot force a repeater with a colliding ID to remain Active.**
        
        If a repeater is flagged as **Excluded** due to an ID collision, manually setting it back to **Active** is futile. The moment MeshMapper receives a new advert or ping from that repeater, the collision detection logic will trigger again, and it will immediately revert to **Excluded**.  In addition, setting a repeaters status to **Disabled** does not bypass collision detection logic.
        
        This is a safety mechanism designed to protect the integrity of the map's data. To resolve this, one of the colliding repeaters must change its ID.  If a repeater that was once a duplicate is no longer physically on the mesh, deleting the repeater will ensure collision detection logic will not trigger for surviving repeaters.

  - **Ping Calc:** A tool to recalculate the total number of pings a repeater has handled.
  - **Notes:** Clicking the note icon will allow you to optionally add a note to the repeater.  On multiregion admin panels, if a repeater belongs to multiple single regions, notes will be combined and edits will be saved to the individual regions.
  - **Lock GPS Coordinates:** Enabling this setting will prevent new adverts from a repeater from updating its location.  This can be used in instances where the GPS coordinates set on the repeater are incorrect and need to be manually overridden.

    !!! warning "Data Inaccuracy Warning"

        Enabling "Lock GPS Coordinates" for a repeater that can or will physically move locations will result in inaccurate data.  Use with caution.

!!! info "Blank Name Adverts"
    If a repeater advert is received with a blank or missing name, MeshMapper will silently reject it — no record will be created or updated. This is a data quality safeguard. If a repeater is not appearing on the map despite being active on the mesh, verify that its name is set correctly on the device.

### Companions
Manage the "Phonebook" of known companions.

  - **Identity:** Map a Public ID (e.g., `12345678...`) to a human-readable Name.
  - **Blocking:** Set a companion's status to **Blocked** to prevent them from uploading data to the map.
  - **Notes:** Clicking the note icon will allow you to optionally add a note to the companion.  On multiregion admin panels, if a repeater belongs to multiple single regions, notes will be combined and edits will be saved to the individual regions.

### Sessions
A historical log of all wardriving sessions.

  - **Metadata:** View details about the device used (App Version, Hardware Model, etc.).
  - **Cleanup:** Options to delete just the pings from a session (keeping the record) or wipe the session entirely.

### Users
Manage user identities to group multiple contacts.

  - **Leaderboard Grouping:** Associate multiple contacts/companions under a single User identity. This ensures that all contributions from these devices are aggregated together on the leaderboards.  The name that will display on the leaderboards is that of the selected Main Companion.
  - **Future Functionality:** Currently, this feature is for administrative grouping only. However, plans are in place to expand this into a full Contributor Portal, allowing users to log in, view their personal statistics, and manage the data they have contributed to MeshMapper.  There are some fields (like Username) that exist for this purpose but are not yet implemented.

### Administrators

The **Administrators** tab displays all admin accounts that have been granted access to your region and allows you to invite new administrators.

  - **Name:** The username of the administrator account.
  - **Contact:** The contact information on file for the administrator (e.g., Discord handle, email).
  - **Region:** On multiregion admin panels, each administrator's entry will display which sub-regions they have been granted access to.
  - **Status:** Indicates whether the administrator has completed registration.
      - **Active:** The administrator has claimed their account and set a key.
      - **Pending Registration:** The administrator has been invited but has not yet claimed their account.

#### Adding a New Administrator

Region admins can invite new administrators directly from this tab by clicking **+ Add Administrator**.

  1. **Username** *(required)*: Choose a username for the new administrator. This must be unique.
  2. **Contact Info** *(required)*: Enter the new administrator's contact information (e.g., Discord handle or email) so they can be reached if needed.
  3. **Region Assignment** *(required)*: Select which region the new administrator should have access to. On multiregion admin panels, you can assign the administrator to the multi-region group or to an individual sub-region.

Once created, a message will display with a registration link and the username. Share both with the new administrator.

#### Registration

New administrators claim their account by visiting [register.meshmapper.net](https://register.meshmapper.net) and entering the username provided to them. If the account exists and has not yet been registered, a **temporary key** will be generated and displayed.

!!! warning "Temporary Key"
    The temporary key is shown **only once** during registration. The new administrator must copy it immediately. After logging in for the first time, they should change their key from the **User Settings** tab.

## Maintenance Tools

The **Tools** tab contains powerful utilities for bulk operations. **Use with caution.**

  - **Replace Repeater**:
    - Useful when a repeater changes its ID or is replaced by new hardware.
    - Scans the entire database and updates all historical pings to point to the new ID.
  
  - **Bulk Delete Pings**:
    - Remove all data for a specific companion or session within a specific time range.

  - **Bulk Update**:
    - Mass-edit attributes for a set of pings.
    - *Example:* Change all pings from companion "Tom_Mobile" on "Dec 25th" to have "External Antenna = YES".

## System Settings

Configure how the map behaves for your region.

  - **Max Session Capacity**: Limit the number of simultaneous wardrivers to prevent mesh congestion.
  - **Hide Companion Names**: Toggle privacy mode for the public map.
  - **Stale Repeater Age**: Set how many hours without an advert before a repeater is considered stale and visually flagged on the map (default: 24 hours). This threshold also drives the automatic duplicate cleanup routine — a colliding repeater that has not been heard in **3× this value** is eligible for automatic deletion. For example, with a 12-hour stale age, stale duplicates are removed after 36 hours of silence. [See Duplicate Repeater IDs](https://wiki.meshmapper.net/duplicaterepeaterid/)
  - **New Repeaters Enter Pending State**: When enabled, newly discovered repeaters will enter a **Pending** state instead of **Active**. Pending repeaters are hidden from the map until an admin reviews and approves them. After 3× the stale timer, pending repeaters are automatically approved if still actively being heard, or deleted if not. In multiregion mode, this setting is configured per-region under Region-Specific Settings.

    !!! warning "Data Inaccuracy Warning"
        New repeaters will not display on the map until approved. This can cause data inaccuracies. Use with caution.

  - **Single Observer Mode**: Enable this if your region relies on a single MQTT ingestor to prevent repeaters from being flagged as "Stale" too quickly. This option prevents the repeater from displaying as stale and ultimately getting disabled at 30 days without an advert.
  - **Public Channels**: Define which channels are treated as public traffic.
  - **Regions/Scopes**: If your region uses MeshCore Regions/Scopes, define it here.  If not, leave the default scope of "*".
  - **Enforce Hybrid Mode**: Disables Active mode for wardrivers in your region.  If your regions mesh has an issue with dropped packets due to high mesh traffic or many wardrivers, consider enabling this option.  *(Mobile app functionality will be available with v1.1.0)*
  - **Minimum Active/Hybrid Mode Interval**: Optionally set the number of seconds between mesh pings for wardrivers in your region.  If your regions mesh has an issue with dropped packets due to high mesh traffic or many wardrivers, consider setting a higher minimum interval.  *(Mobile app functionality will be available with v1.1.0)*
  - **Region Message**: Optionally add a message here that will display to map visitors when they click the "Region Info" option.  Direct guests to your Discord server, website, etc.  Field is plain-text and will automatically convert URLs to clickable links.
  - **Social Media Links**: Optionally add any number of social media or website links that will display on the "Region Info" window on your regions map.
  - **MQTT Observers**: Configure the list of letsmesh observers to ingest from.
  - **Subscribe to all local observers**: This gives a region the option to either define which observers make up their mesh and exclude everything else (when off), or by toggling this on, listen for packets from any connected observer in the IATA. Turning this off and defining which observers to use could be helpful in cases where someone has fired up an observer and connected it with an IATA, but in reality its far away from the actual region and not contributing to the mesh.
  - **Disable Duplicate ID Detection Logic**: Allows the region to opt-out of MeshMapper's strict duplicate ID collision handling. When enabled, repeaters with colliding IDs will remain active, and pings will associate with all matching repeaters.
    - *Warning:* This compromises data accuracy. A warning badge will be displayed on the public map, and the region will be excluded from global leaderboards.

## Alerts & History

  - **Alerts**: Automatically detects configuration issues, such as **Duplicate Repeater IDs** (Collisions) and **Pending Repeaters** awaiting approval.
  - **History**: An audit log of all administrative actions (who edited what and when), ensuring accountability.

## Notifications

Link your Discord to MeshMapper to receive DM's from the MeshMapper bot.

  - **Alert on Duplicate Repeater ID**: Notifies you when a repeater has sent an advert, but its ID collides with another, putting both repeaters into Excluded status.  [See Duplicate Repeater ID](https://wiki.meshmapper.net/duplicaterepeaterid)
  - **Alert on Pending Repeater**: Once a day, receive a notification if your region has repeaters in **Pending** state that are awaiting review.  This notification is only relevant if "New Repeaters Enter Pending State" is enabled for the region.
  - **Allow Messages From Visitors**: When enabled, a map visitor can send a message to you directly from the "Region Info" page of your regions map.
  - **Alert on Offline Observer**: Once a day (around 0800 EST/EDT) MeshMapper will review all data received via your regions MQTT observers (pings, repeater adverts, companion adverts) for the past 7 days.  If a particular observer has sent data within that time, but not within the "Stale Repeater Age" time configured for your region, then this observer is potentially offline.  Receive an alert when this is the case.
